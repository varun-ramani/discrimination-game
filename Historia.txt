Game skele-plot:

There will be Alternative endings

You are a spanish speaking person and can choose to be a discriminator or a nice guy/gal

Basically there will be many people you will meet and different choices to pick and whatever
you say will be remembered by those people.

In the end you will be scored based on how racist/sexist/any-other-ists you are and that score will
give you your ending.
