# Discrimination Game
A Java-powered textual RPG that addresses societal stereotypes.
## Motivation
During a Spanish class I took during my sophomore year of high school, I was
tasked with the creation of a capstone project for the discrimination unit,
which addressed identity-based stereotypes in society through a Spanish-language
lens. 

As such, I opted to create the game featured in this repository. The user plays
through a week of social interactions with members of various communities, with
the objective of coming to terms with their own implicit and explicit biases
through the course of the game. 

This project is not designed to be offensive in any way, but rather to shed
light on social issues. However, due to the sensitive subject matter, coupled
with the fact that I created this during a time when I was much younger, it is
possible that some of the content will be questionable. Furthermore, the game
itself is in a language that I was unfamiliar with at the time (Spanish), so if
this game offends you in any way, please regard it as an unintentional faux pas.

## Try it!
I retroactively Dockerized this project, so you can run it with a simple `docker
run -it --rm ghcr.io/varun-ramani/discrimination-game:main`, although you will have to sign into GitHub Packages from Docker beforehand.
